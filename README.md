# MLOps with Kubeflow KServe AWS

## Short Description
This project implements a machine learning pipeline using Kubernetes on AWS EC2. Kind creates a local Kubernetes cluster where Kubeflow Pipelines orchestrates model training and evaluation. The trained model is stored in S3 and deployed using KServe for serving predictions. This architecture provides a scalable, cloud-integrated ML workflow with reproducible pipelines.
